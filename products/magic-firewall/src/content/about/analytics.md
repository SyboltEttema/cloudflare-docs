# Magic Firewall Analytics

Magic Transit users can access **Network Analytics** for a detailed view of packets mitigated from attacks.

From **Network Analytics** in your dashboard, you can view a variety of information such as Average packet rate, the number of mitigated attacks, packet summary information, and more. 

Under **Packet summary**, click a tab to view specific information for that category and then hover over the graph to view data points from specific time frames. 

Under **Activity Log**, click an entry to expand it and view detailed information about an attack.
